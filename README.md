# travelsteps
Pet project to play around with cool technologies such as AWS, REST, Single Page Application, Angular, etc.

The idea is to create an application to track steps of an ongoing (or not) travel, so you can share with friends.
Business requirements are still not clear as the client (myselft) doesn't know exactly what he wants, but initially we want the ability to:
- Register user (possibly use Facebook, Google, Twitter APIs)
- Create travels
- Store text/photos/videos
- Mark the place the text/photo/video was took (read from metadata)
- Display the text/photos/videos in a map
